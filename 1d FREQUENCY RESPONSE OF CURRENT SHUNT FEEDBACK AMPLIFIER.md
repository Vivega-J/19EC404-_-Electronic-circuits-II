### **Result**

Thus the current shunt feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | =25Hz | =250Hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | =170Hz | =450Hz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = \) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = \) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = \) | \( A'{v(mid)} = \) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 23.5db | 22.54db |

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current shunt feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
